Forecasting the data is very usefull skill in predicting the future values.

->When we have limited data to test and we want to know much about direction of the trend line  
  the simple way is to use forecasting using excel.

->With this we can we know lower and upper bound as well and direction of trend line can be predicted

->here in the used data of youtube views vs date dataset we need to predict the how many view he can get on particular date in future.  
  we have only 300 odd values to train and 6 to test.  
  In this case prediction using excel will be good as we have very limited data.

Final verdict  
->The channel views will be growing.
->However the rate of growth og channel views depends on extenal factors like how consistenly vedios are being uploaded and  
  how good the vedios are and how much the content is attracting the audience.
